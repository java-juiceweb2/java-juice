                    <h2>Boolean Logic</h2>
                    <p>
                        For a program to be useful, often times a decision has to be 
                        made whether to run a certain section of code or not.  In a 
                        program, these decisions can be made using what's known as 
                        "Boolean logic" named after an English mathematician George 
                        Boole.  At its core, Boolean logic boils down to true and 
                        false.  Conditionals, as they're known, are sections of code
                        where one or more conditions must be true to execute.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Java has a built-in Boolean data type, known as a boolean.
                        The value of a boolean may be either true or false.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <!-- start of if/else loop lesson -->
                    <h2>If/Else</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Java, the code that deals with determining whether or not 
                        to run a section of code is known as an "if-block".  A 
                        simple outline of what they look like is shown below:
                    </p>
<pre>if (condition) {
    code to run if condition is true
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        If a program must decide if it should run one set of code or
                        another if the condition fails, an else block can be used
                        which the program runs if the condition is found to be 
                        false.  An example of that looks like the following:
                    </p>
<pre>if (condition) {
    code to run if condition is true
} else {
    code to run if condition is false
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        If, when an if-conditional evaluates to false, a different
                        conditional should be checked, part of an if-block can be an
                        "else if", which allows for secondary condition checking.
                        A simple example can be found below:
                    </p>
<pre>if (condition1) {
    code to run if condition1 is true
} else if (conditon2) {
    code to run if condition2 is true
} else {
    code to run if both are false
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        The final "else" isn't required, but it is effectively the
                        "if all else fails" section of code.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
                    <p>
                        Say you want to test if one variable is greater than or 
                        equal to 5, how would you go about doing that?  Java has a 
                        number of what's known as comparison operators that can be 
                        used to compare two items.  The example described would be 
                        written like this:
                    </p>
<pre>if (var1 &gt;= 5){
    code to run
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        What if you wanted to compare the values of two variables 
                        though?  Simple replace the "5" with the other variable's 
                        name.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The other comparison operators found in Java are outlined 
                        below:
                    </p>
<pre>
== : "equal to"
!= : "NOT equal to"
&lt;  : "less than"
&lt;= : "less than or equal to"
&gt;  : "greater than"
&gt;= : "greater than or equal to"
</pre>
                    <h2>Chaining Conditions</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes a program needs to check if several conditions are
                        met before running a section of code.  This can be achieved
                        using a series of ANDs, ORs and NOTs.  For example, if you
                        want to run a section of code if a integer variable "var1" 
                        is greater than 5 <strong>AND</strong> a variable "var2" is
                        the same as var1, you would write:
                    </p>
<pre>if (var1 &gt; 5 && var2 == var1) {
    code to run
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        In plain English, this is read "if var1 is greater than 5 
                        and var2 equals var1, run the code."  Using an AND means that
                        if either of the conditions is not true, the code will not 
                        run.  But what if you wanted to run the code if one or the 
                        other was true?  This is where the OR comes in handy.  Using
                        the example above, if you wanted to run the code if var1 is
                        greater than 5 OR var2 is exactly var1, you would write:
                    </p>
<pre>if (var1 &gt; 5 || var2 == var1) {
    code to run
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        By this point you might be confused what these "&&" and "||"
                        bits are.  In Java, to denote a conditional AND, two 
                        ampersands (&&) are needed.  Similarly, two pipe characters
                        (||, typed by pressing shift and the backslash key) 
                        indicates a conditional OR.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Sometimes you might want to run a section of code if a 
                        condition is NOT true.  This is where the Boolean inverse
                        comes in handy.  Say you want to run a section of code if
                        var2 is NOT 5.  To do this you would write:
                    </p>
<pre>if (var2 != 5) {
    code to run
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        Java's Boolean inverse is denoted by an exclamation point,
                        "!".  If you want to see if something is NOT equal you use
                        "!=", however this isn't the only use of the NOT denoter.  
                        If you want to flip the result of an entire condition, you 
                        can wrap it in parentheses and put an exclamation point 
                        before it.  Using an example used before:
                    </p>
<pre>if (!(var1 &gt; 5 || var2 == var1) ) {
    code to run
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        In English, this is like saying: "If var1 is greater than 5
                        or var2 is exactly 5, do not run this code."  Boolean logic
                        can be distributed much like multiplication, so the above
                        example can be rewritten to be:
                    </p>
<pre>if (var1 &lt;= 5 && var1 != var2) {
    code to run
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        You'll notice here that everything has been flipped to be
                        the "opposite" comparison.  When distributing a NOT, every
                        comparison is flipped to be what is the exact opposite (as
                        it is the boolean inverse). Equals, "==" becomes "!=", "&lt;" 
                        becomes "&gt;=", and "||" becomes "&&".  We'll discuss more 
                        in the next section about what the inverse of each Boolean
                        logic item is.

                    <h2>Some Truths</h2>
                    <p>
                        Below are the basic truths that affect Boolean operations
                        and their "logical equivalents".
                    </p>
                    <h3>AND</h3>
                    <pre>if (!condition1 && !condition2) {...}</pre>
                    <p>is logically equivalent to</p>
                    <pre>if (!(condition1 || condition2)) {...}</pre>
                    <h3>OR</h3>

                    <p>is logically equivalent to</p>
                    <pre>if (!(condition1 && condition2)) {...}</pre>
                    <h3>EQUALS</h3>
                    <pre>if (var1 != var2) {...}</pre>
                    <p>is logically equivalent to</p>
                    <pre>if (!(condition1 == condition2)) {...}</pre>
                    <h3>LESS/GREATER THAN</h3>
                    <pre>if (var1 &gt;= var2) {...}</pre>
                    <p>is logically equivalent to</p>
                    <pre>if (!(condition1 &lt; condition2)) {...}</pre>
                    <p>
                        There are of course others, but these highlight the main 
                        equivalents that are encountered most often while 
                        programming.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Short-Circuit Evaluation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Java attempts to optimize the amount of conditions that are
                        tested by only performing as many checks as it needs.  
                        For example, a sequence of conditions separated by ORs is 
                        true if ANY of the conditions are true, so Java will only
                        go as far as it needs to get a true result.  If var1 is 5 
                        and var2 is false and we have the code:
                    </p>
                    <pre>if (var1 == 5 || var2) {...}</pre>
                    <p>
                        Java won't even check for the value of var2 since "var1==5" 
                        is true.  This is a process known as short-circuit 
                        evaluation.  
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        As a small aside about the above snippet, if a variable is a 
                        boolean type to begin with, there is no need to see if it is 
                        equal to true or false.  If you want to check if a boolean 
                        variable is true you can simply write:
                    </p>
<pre>if (var1) {
    code to run
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, if you want to execute the code in the if-block
                        if var1 is false, you can write:
                    </p>
<pre>if (!var1) {
    code to run
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        Now back to short-circuit evaluation.  The same process is
                        applied to ANDs.  If any of the conditions evaluate to 
                        false, the entire block will evaulate to false, and thus
                        if Java evaluates a comparison to false, the entire section
                        becomes false.

                    <p>
                        The last step in mastering Boolean logic, is knowing that
                        in an if-block, groups of comparisons can be grouped 
                        together by parentheses, and they will be evaluated much 
                        like how PEMDAS works.  See the following code for an 
                        example of this:
                    </p>
<pre>if ((var1 == var2 || var1 == 5) && var1 > 2){
    code to run
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        When the program is running, Java will first go into the
                        parentheses around the first two conditions and evaluate 
                        that to a single Boolean value before continuing on with the
                        rest of the conditions.  Parentheses help make code more 
                        readable by others and allow for more explicitly stating 
                        which sections of an if-block are related to one another.
