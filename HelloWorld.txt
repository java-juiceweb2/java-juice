Classes will be explained more in depth later on 
but for now, think of them as a single concept.

The idea of the HelloWorld program is to teach you 
the basics of the java language.

When naming a class in your program, each word in the 
name is capitalized (ex. "HelloWorld"). 

Inside the primary class, we have the main() method.
The syntax for the main() class will be explained more 
later.

	public static void main(String[] args){

	}

In order to print out a line in a program, you will 
need to call a method System.out.println();

	System.out.println("Hello World");

This method will print out a message on the screen.
