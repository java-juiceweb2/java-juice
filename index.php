                        Java was designed to be simple to learn, understand and
                        write.  Software can be written once and run on most
                        systems, making Java the choice candidate for many
                        applications. Java Juice makes the learning process 
                        intuitive and fun.

                        Java has been around since the mid-1990s.  Throughout
                        its years of existence, Java has built up a large
                        community of people sharing their knowledge.  Don't know 
                        how to do something? There's a good chance someone else 
                        will.

                        According to the 
                        <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank">TIOBE Index</a>,
                        Java is the software industry's widest adopted language.
                        From companies like Netflix and Airbnb, to LinkedIn and
                        Lyft, Java can be found nearly everywhere.
