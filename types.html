            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language however not all data types are objects. In fact, a String is the only data type that has to be an object. Java relies on what are known as primitive data types. The 8 primitives in Java are (in
                order of byte size): 1. byte (a number, 1 byte) 2. boolean (true or false, 1 byte) 3. short (a number, 2 bytes) 4. char (a character, 2 bytes) 5. int (a number, 4 bytes) 6. float (a floating point number, 4 bytes) 7. long (a number, 8
                bytes) 8. double (a floating point number, 8 bytes) * A floating point number is a number that has a decimal point, ex. 3.1459, 3.0, 9.06 When you declare a variable you must declare it's data type. To create a variable of type integer
                simply declare the type (int) the name for the variable and what it equals. int num = 8; You can also declare a variable and then assign it's value later. int num; num = 8; You might want to use this if the value of your variable is going
                to be determined later in the program. To define a double simply declare the data type. double num = 9.7; If you want to use a float (to save memory) you will have to type cast your number. float num = (float) 9.7; or you can use the shorthand
                float num = 9.7f; Type Casting is an easy way to convert data from one data type to another data type. For example, you can typecast an int data type to a double data type. int i = 5; double d = (double) i; You can not cast a double down
                to an int, for this you would have to use a method such as double d = 5.25; int i = d.intValue(); Declaring a long, short or byte follow the same pattern as declaring an int or double. Every number datatype can use mathematical operators
                such as +, -, *, / to manipulate the values. If you want more advanced operations you can refer to the Math class (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html) A char is a single character and is declared like char c
                = 'c'; A char uses single quotes and can only be one character. A String is declared with double quotes. A String is not a primitive data type it is of the class Object. String str = "Hello"; You can join strings together using string
                concatenation with the plus (+) operator. String str1 = "Hello "; Strirng str2 = "World"; System.out.println(str1 + str2); // will print out Hello World A boolean is a special primitive data type it only accepts values of true or false.
                This is helpful for comparisons. boolean keepGoing = true; // declaring the boolean // here the if statements check the truth of the boolean variable keepGoing // if it is true the code will excute if (keepGoing) { System.out.println("I
                will keep going"); }
